            We welcome you to the Sipalaya InfoTech learning fraternity! We
            always strive to maintain the highest standards of quality, so that
            your learning experience with us is above reproach. However, if for
            any reason your expectations are not met, please note our
            Cancellations and Refund policy which is as follows:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <span>Cancellation</span>
          <p>
            In case you are unable to attend the course and want a refund prior
            to the course commencement date, we will be happy to give you back
            the full amount.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <span>Withdrawal</span>
          <p>
            If you want to discontinue within the first two hours, we will still
            proceed with the 100% refund, absolutely no questions asked!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <span>Transfer</span>
          <p>
            However, once you have completed 50% of the training, you will not
            be eligible for any refund. If for any reason you are unable to
            continue the course after having completed 50% of the training, we
            would be happy to accommodate you in a different batch of the same
            course, at no cost.
          </p>
        </div>
        <span>
          Note: All refunds will be credited back to your account within 10-15
          business days of the refund request.
